"""Anima ComfyUI custom nodes.

Three single-purpose loader nodes that each take a MODEL, apply one kind
of Anima-trained intervention, and return a MODEL. Chain them when a
workflow needs more than one.

  - ``AnimaAdapterLoader``: LoRA / HydraLoRA / ReFT (auto-detected from
    the safetensors keys + metadata). Installs ComfyUI weight patches for
    plain LoRA, per-Linear forward hooks for HydraLoRA live routing
    (σ-conditional and/or FeRA-style FEI-conditional on the Hydra stack),
    and per-block forward hooks for ReFT.
  - ``AnimaFeraLoader``: author-faithful FeRA (Yin et al., arXiv:2511.17979)
    — global router on the latent's spectral energy + per-Linear stacked
    independent experts. Different network family from
    ``AnimaAdapterLoader``'s Hydra/FEI variant: incompatible save format,
    mutually exclusive with HydraLoRA-moe (load one, not both).
  - ``AnimaSoftTokensLoader``: SoftREPA-parameterization soft tokens.
    Per-block forward pre-hooks splice per-layer x per-timestep-bucket
    learned tokens into the crossattn embedding inside the first n_layers
    DiT blocks; a diffusion_model pre-hook records the per-step sigma.

``AnimaFeraLoader`` was added in v3.1.0; ``AnimaSoftTokensLoader`` in
v3.6.0. The ``AnimaPostfixLoader`` node was retired when the postfix
training method was archived (the prefix / postfix / cond splice has no
live trainer; see the repo's _archive/postfix/).
