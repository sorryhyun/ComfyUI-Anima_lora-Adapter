# ComfyUI-Anima_lora-Adapter

> Standalone, published ComfyUI node — extracted from `anima_lora/custom_nodes/comfyui-hydralora/`. The router kernels under `_vendor/` are **not** edited here: they are the canonical anima_lora training tree, written into this repo by `scripts/sync_vendor.py` *in the anima_lora repo* (run `make vendor-sync` there). Edit node logic here; edit kernels in anima_lora.

ComfyUI custom nodes that dispatch Anima-trained interventions (LoRA / HydraLoRA / ReFT / soft tokens) through ComfyUI's patching system. Exists because vanilla ComfyUI's weight-patcher silently drops non-LoRA keys (`reft_*`, `lora_ups`, soft-token banks), so a Hydra/ReFT/soft-token checkpoint loaded with a stock LoRA loader produces wrong output with no warning.

Four single-purpose nodes (adapter + postfix split in v3.0.0, FeRA added in v3.1.0, soft tokens in v3.6.0, postfix loader retired in v3.7.0, per-step-expert turbo added later):

  - `AnimaAdapterLoader` — LoRA / HydraLoRA / ReFT (`adapter.py`).
  - `AnimaFeraLoader` — author-faithful FeRA (`fera.py`).
  - `AnimaSoftTokensLoader` — SoftREPA-parameterization soft tokens (`soft_tokens.py`).
  - `AnimaTurboPerStepExpertLoader` — per-step-expert turbo students (`step_expert.py`). Head k → denoise step k by a step counter; needs cfg=1.0 and infer_steps = trained K. Mutually exclusive with the other loaders on the same checkpoint.

Chain them `MODEL → <adapter or fera> → AnimaSoftTokensLoader → MODEL` when a workflow needs more than one; later nodes see the model with earlier modifications already in place. `AnimaAdapterLoader` and `AnimaFeraLoader` are mutually exclusive — author-faithful FeRA and HydraLoRA-moe are alternative router schemes (see `library/inference/models.py`). The `AnimaPostfixLoader` (prefix / postfix / cond splice) was retired in v3.7.0 when the postfix training method was archived (`_archive/postfix/`); soft tokens cover the per-block crossattn-splice case now.

Full user-facing docs and changelog live in `README.md`. This file is for code-level edits to the node.

## Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `adapter.py` | LoRA / Hydra / ReFT key parsing, classification, hook install + the `load_adapter` / `apply_adapter` top-level dispatch. Owns the live-or-vendor resolver for `library.inference.router_compute` and re-exports the kernel names (`gaussian_blur_2d`, `compute_fei_2band`, `compute_fei_nband_high_to_low`, `fei_sigma_low`, `sigma_sinusoidal_features`, `apply_sigma_band_mask`, `fei_temperature`) so `chimera.py` / `fera.py` and the Hydra hooks share one source of truth. Single-A chimera apply still lives here (inside `_apply_hydra_live_to_model`'s chimera branch — single-A and plain Hydra share the same `lora_down` + per-expert `lora_ups.{i}` shape and the same dispatch loop, so they're co-located). |
| `chimera.py` | ChimeraHydra parse + hook factories + dual-A apply: `_parse_chimera_content_router`, `_parse_chimera_dual_a`, `_attach_single_a_chimera_metadata` / `_finalize_dual_a_chimera` (the two metadata-validation helpers called from `load_adapter`), `_make_content_router_llm_adapter_hook`, `_make_chimera_pre_hook`, `_make_chimera_hook`, `_make_chimera_dual_a_hook`, `_apply_chimera_dual_a_to_model`. Imports kernel re-exports + `_T5_PAD_LEN` + `_resolve_module` from `adapter.py`; `adapter.py` re-imports the public hook factories and apply entry so calling sites in `_apply_hydra_live_to_model` (single-A chimera branch) and `apply_adapter` look unchanged. |
| `fera.py` | Author-faithful FeRA + plan2 `stacked_experts_global_fei` parsing + apply. Imports the FEI kernels from `adapter.py` — the ordering split (high→low for author-faithful, low→high for plan2) lives on the kernel names, not duplicated implementations. |
| `soft_tokens.py` | SoftREPA soft-token bank loading (`load_soft_tokens`) + per-block splice via `forward_pre_hook`. Standalone — no ComfyUI imports at module scope (only `apply_soft_tokens` touches the ModelPatcher), and no router-compute dependency, so it isn't part of the `_vendor` surface. |
| `step_expert.py` | Per-step-expert turbo (`ss_turbo_per_step_expert=1`): shared `lora_down` + K up-heads, head k → denoise step k by a forward-count-modulo-K counter (no router). `parse_step_expert` discriminates on the metadata stamp (the `.lora_ups.{k}.weight` shape alone is ambiguous with Hydra) and splits fused qkv/kv → q/k/v (`_ATTN_FUSE_SPECS` inlined, so no cross-package dep). `apply_step_expert` installs a `diffusion_model._forward_pre_hooks` step-counter pre-hook + per-Linear `forward_hook`s. No router-compute dependency → exempt from `_vendor`. Reuses `_resolve_module` from `adapter.py`. |
| `nodes.py` | `AnimaAdapterLoader` + `AnimaFeraLoader` + `AnimaSoftTokensLoader` ComfyUI node definitions. |
| `__init__.py` | Re-exports `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS` / `NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS`. |
| `_vendor/` | Bundled copy of `library/inference/router_compute.py` + transitive deps (`library/runtime/fei.py`, `networks/lora_modules/router_state.py`). **Written into this repo** by `scripts/sync_vendor.py` in the anima_lora repo (`make vendor-sync` there) — the authoritative router kernels at inference. Do not hand-edit. |

## Router-compute single source of truth

All pure-compute router kernels (Gaussian blur, FEI 2-band / n-band, σ sinusoidal features, σ-band mask) live in `library/inference/router_compute.py`. The training side imports the same functions through `library.runtime.fei` and `networks.lora_modules.router_state`; `router_compute.py` is a façade that gives the node a single import surface and a clean vendor target.

Trained router weights are bit-sensitive to band ordering and the σ frequency schedule — any drift between the live tree and the vendored copy produces silently corrupted gates at inference (no exception). The contract is pinned by `tests/test_router_compute.py`, which asserts identity (`is`) between the façade's exports and the canonical training-side functions. Run `make vendor-sync` before publishing a new node version — see [[feedback_vendor_sync]].

## Application paths (which key goes where)

Each node sniffs its safetensors header and routes each component independently — paths are disjoint:

| Component | Application path |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Plain LoRA | `ModelPatcher.add_patches` (standard ComfyUI weight patch). |
| HydraLoRA | Per-Linear `forward_hook` installed via `ModelPatcher.add_object_patch` on each adapted Linear's `_forward_hooks`. |
| FeRA (author-faithful) | One global `forward_pre_hook` on `diffusion_model._forward_pre_hooks` computes per-step FEI + router gates; per-Linear `forward_hook`s on each adapted Linear's `_forward_hooks` add the gated stacked-expert correction. Same hook-not-override invariant as Hydra. |
| ReFT | Per-block `forward_hook` installed via `ModelPatcher.add_object_patch` on `diffusion_model.blocks.<idx>._forward_hooks`. |
| Soft tokens | Per-block `forward_pre_hook` on the first `n_layers` `diffusion_model.blocks.<idx>._forward_pre_hooks` rewrites each block's `crossattn_emb` arg; one `diffusion_model._forward_pre_hooks` pre-hook records per-step σ and precomputes the bank. Whole batch (both CFG branches). Hook-not-override invariant holds (block `forward` is untouched). |

## Critical invariant: forward_hook, never override `forward`

For Hydra and ReFT, install a `forward_hook` — do **not** replace `block.forward` / `linear.forward`. Overriding `forward` strands weights on CPU under ComfyUI's cast-weights path: ComfyUI walks the real `forward` to drive its `comfy_cast_weights` machinery, and replacing the method confuses it — blocks end up with `comfy_cast_weights=False` and their Linears stay on CPU, producing a device mismatch at runtime. A hook leaves `forward` untouched, traces cleanly through `torch.compile`, and is properly reverted on `unpatch_model`.

Soft tokens honor the rule by splicing at the block level: a `forward_pre_hook` (not a `forward` override) returns a modified positional-args tuple, so `crossattn_emb` (block arg index 2) is rewritten before `forward` runs. Pre-hooks that return a non-`None` value replace the call's args — that's the supported way to edit a block's inputs without touching its `forward`. (The retired postfix loader used the same block-level pre-hook for the same reason; an earlier version *did* replace `diffusion_model.forward` to run `preprocess_text_embeds` itself, which stranded the DiT's own `x_embedder` on CPU under ComfyUI's dynamic-VRAM / cast-weights staging walk — even a model-level forward override is unsafe there.)

## Soft tokens (SoftREPA splice)

`soft_tokens.py` runs `networks/methods/soft_tokens.py` checkpoints (`tokens` `(n_layers, K, D)` + `t_offsets.weight` `(n_t_buckets, n_layers·D)`) live. Two pieces of per-load shared state, written once per denoising step by a `diffusion_model._forward_pre_hooks` pre-hook:

- **σ** recovered from `args[1]`. **Gotcha:** comfy's FLOW sampling hands the diffusion model `timesteps = sigma × 1000` (`ModelSamplingDiscreteFlow`, multiplier 1000), but the trainer's t-bucket index (`SoftTokensNetwork._bucketize`) runs on σ ∈ `[0, 1]` (`train.py` draws `[0,1]`-scaled timesteps; `library/inference/generation.py` divides by 1000 before `append_postfix`). So the pre-hook divides `args[1]` by 1000 (`_FLOW_MULTIPLIER`) before bucketizing. Get this wrong and every step lands in the last bucket. (The Hydra σ-feature path doesn't divide — but the shipped FEI/FeRA defaults have `sigma_feature_dim=0`, so that path is dormant; don't copy its `args[1]`-as-σ handling here.)
- **`step_tokens`** `(n_layers, B, K, D)`: base `tokens` + the per-(bucket, layer) offset, scaled by the node's `strength`.

Each of the first `n_layers` blocks gets a `forward_pre_hook` that indexes `step_tokens[layer_idx]` and splices it into `crossattn_emb` — `end_of_sequence` overwrites the K padding-tail slots (static slice+cat), `front_of_padding` derives per-sample seqlens from the non-zero mask and scatters after the real text (same as `postfix.py::_splice_postfix`). Applies to the whole batch (both CFG branches) — soft tokens are conditioning the trainer always saw, unlike postfix's positive-only splice. Hook installs go through `get_model_object`, which resolves the full dotted `_forward_pre_hooks` key through prior object-patches, so chaining after an adapter that already patched `diffusion_model._forward_pre_hooks` composes instead of clobbering. No `_vendor` dependency (no router-compute kernels), so soft tokens are exempt from the vendor-sync contract.

## Router-input layout (σ + FEI)

Routing is data-driven: `router = Linear(rank + sigma_dim + fei_dim, E)` with the input built as `[pooled, sinusoidal(σ), FEI]` — concat order matters and must match `networks/lora_modules/hydra.py::_compute_gate`. A forward pre-hook on `diffusion_model._forward_pre_hooks` records the current `timesteps` (`args[1]`) and — for FeRA-style FEI routing — the per-step 2-band Laplacian energy of `args[0]` (the latent, squeezed of any T=1 dim) into shared state on each denoising call. Every Hydra hook reads from that state to build its router input.

**The shape alone is ambiguous.** `router.weight.shape[1] - rank` does not tell you whether the extra columns are σ or FEI — only the safetensors metadata can. `load_adapter` reads `ss_use_fei_router` / `ss_fei_feature_dim` / `ss_fei_sigma_low_div`, and `_apply_hydra_live_to_model` derives `sigma_feature_dim = router_in - rank - fei_feature_dim`. Without that metadata flag the node assumes FEI is off and treats all extra columns as σ-feature columns (the historical behavior for σ-only checkpoints).

## ChimeraHydra (dual-pool additive routing)

`ss_use_chimera_hydra="true"` flips `AnimaAdapterLoader` to a dual-pool path. Two on-disk formats exist:

### Legacy single-A (pre-c4851b6, single `lora_down` shared across both pools)

Shape contract is HydraLoRA-MoE (shared `lora_down` + per-expert `lora_ups.{i}`) **plus** top-level `freq_router.net.*` keys, where:

- The per-Linear router shrinks to `(K_c, rank)` — `K_c = ss_num_experts_content`, no σ/FEI columns. Reads pooled rank-R `lx` only.
- Per-Linear hook concatenates `[π_c, π_f]` over `E = K_c + K_f` experts and dispatches the standard Hydra einsum/bmm.

Detection / dispatch: `load_adapter` writes `bundle["hydra"]["chimera"]`; `_apply_hydra_live_to_model` swaps `_make_router_pre_hook` for `_make_chimera_pre_hook` and `_make_hydra_hook` for `_make_chimera_hook`.

### Dual-A (post-c4851b6, two independent `lora_down_{c,f}` per Linear)

Shape contract is per-pool: `lora_down_c.weight` + `lora_down_f.weight` (each `(r, in)`), per-pool stacked ups `lora_ups_c.{i}.weight` / `lora_ups_f.{j}.weight` (each `(out, r)`), K_c-narrow content router, top-level `freq_router.net.*`. The two pools each carry their own SVD-partitioned subspace (Q_basis_c.row ⊥ Q_basis_f.row, P_bases_c.col ⊥ P_bases_f.col) and bake `lambda_{c,f}` into the saved weights via the sqrt-split in `_convert_chimera_dual_a_to_hydra`.

- Per-Linear hook (`_make_chimera_dual_a_hook`): down-projects `x` separately to `lx_c` and `lx_f`, runs the content router on pooled `lx_c` only, sums gate-weighted `out_c + out_f`. No `alpha/rank` scale at inference (mirrors training where the chimera modules ignore `alpha` and bake all scaling into `lambda_{c,f}`).
- FreqRouter pre-hook is unchanged (`_make_chimera_pre_hook` — same input shape, same `[FEI, sinusoidal(σ)]` concat order).

Detection / dispatch: `load_adapter` writes `bundle["chimera_dual_a"]` (a top-level sibling of `bundle["hydra"]` — distinct from the legacy `bundle["hydra"]["chimera"]`); `_apply_chimera_dual_a_to_model` installs the dual-A hooks. The two paths are mutually exclusive by key shape — a single checkpoint cannot mix legacy and dual-A on the same prefix.

### Freq routing mode: learned vs hardwired FEI (`ss_chimera_freq_router_mode`)

The freq pool's gate `π_f` comes from one of two paths, selected by `ss_chimera_freq_router_mode` (absent ⇒ `"learned"`, so all pre-2026-05-27 checkpoints are unaffected):

- **`"learned"`** — the network-level FreqRouter MLP described under Shared invariants below.
- **`"fei"`** — no FreqRouter weights on disk. `_parse_freq_router_mode` reads the stamp + `ss_chimera_freq_router_tau`; `_attach_single_a_chimera_metadata` / `_finalize_dual_a_chimera` set `freq_router_sd=None` and require `fei_feature_dim == K_f` (the FEI band-simplex IS the gate). `_make_chimera_pre_hook` then emits `π_f = fei_temperature(FEI[:, :K_f], τ) = normalize(FEI**(1/τ))` — no MLP, no σ-features. Mirrors the training-side `set_fei` chimera branch under `freq_router_mode="fei"`. Both single-A and dual-A formats share this one pre-hook. See repo `docs/experimental/chimera-hydra.md` §Freq routing mode for why this is the default.

### Shared invariants

- The network-level FreqRouter MLP (`Linear → SiLU → Linear → softmax/τ`, weights `freq_router.net.{0,2}.weight/bias`, **learned mode only**) runs once per denoising step on `concat(FEI(z_t), sinusoidal(σ))` and emits `π_f ∈ (B, K_f)`. Concat order matches `networks/lora_anima/network.py::set_fei` chimera branch (`[FEI, σ]`).
- σ-band partition is unsupported (the FreqRouter owns the σ axis) and force-skipped even if metadata claims it.
- T-LoRA's content-branch rank mask is training-only and intentionally not applied at inference — same rationale as plain T-LoRA (`[[project_tlora_inference_full_rank]]`).
- Old `sigma_mlp.*` checkpoints are not supported (see README §2.1.0).

### Global ContentRouter (`content_router_source="crossattn"`)

When chimera was trained with `content_router_source="crossattn"`, the per-Linear `router.weight/bias` keys (shape `(K_c, rank)`) are **absent** — `ChimeraHydraInferenceModule.__init__` sets `self.router = None` under that mode. Instead, a network-level `ContentRouter` MLP (`Linear → SiLU → Linear → softmax/τ`, weights `content_router.net.{0,2}.weight/bias`) consumes the **pooled post-LLM-adapter `crossattn_emb`** and emits `π_c ∈ (B, K_c)`, broadcast to every chimera Linear via the same slot-assign contract as `π_f`.

Detection: `ss_chimera_content_router_source == "crossattn"` in safetensors metadata. `load_adapter` then parses `content_router.net.*` into `chimera_data["content_router"]` and stamps `chimera_data["content_router_source"] = "crossattn"`. `ss_chimera_content_router_layer_norm` controls whether a parameterless LN is applied to the pooled vector before the MLP (matches training).

Application path differs from the freq pool — the input is text features, which are only materialized **inside** `diffusion_model.forward` (when `self.llm_adapter(...)` runs). A pre-hook on `diffusion_model._forward_pre_hooks` fires too early. So:

- `_make_content_router_llm_adapter_hook` is installed via `add_object_patch("diffusion_model.llm_adapter._forward_hooks", ...)` — a `forward_hook` on the LLM adapter itself. It captures the adapter output `(B, L_text, D)`, zero-pads to `_T5_PAD_LEN = 512` (matches `Anima.preprocess_text_embeds`), RMS-pools over the sequence dim, optionally LayerNorms over D, runs the MLP, and writes `router_state["pi_c"]`.
- Per-Linear chimera hooks (`_make_chimera_hook` / `_make_chimera_dual_a_hook`) are flagged with `global_content_router=True` in their `params` dict, which makes them skip the per-Linear pooled-softmax and broadcast `router_state["pi_c"]` instead (with uniform `1/K_c` fallback if the llm_adapter hook hasn't fired yet).
- The `router_w`/`router_b` requirement in both apply paths (`_apply_hydra_live_to_model` chimera branch + `_apply_chimera_dual_a_to_model`) is dropped under the global router — those keys are absent by design.

CFG composes naturally: ComfyUI batches cond + uncond through one `diffusion_model.forward`, the LLM adapter runs once over `(2B, L, D)`, the hook pools per-sample, and `π_c` already varies per row.

Hard error if the file claims `crossattn` but is missing `content_router.net.*` (malformed checkpoint), or if the loaded DiT has no `llm_adapter` attribute (non-Anima model — the router has no input). Caveats:

- The hook runs `torch._dynamo.disable`d (same as the chimera pre-hook) — softmax/τ at small τ underflows in bf16, so it stays fp32.
- `_T5_PAD_LEN` is hardcoded to 512 because T5 tokenization and `Anima.preprocess_text_embeds` both pin it. If T5 max_length ever varies, plumb a metadata stamp.
- Postfix composes fine — postfix splices its vectors into `crossattn_emb` at the block level (per-block pre-hooks), which fire *after* the `llm_adapter` `forward_hook`, so the content router always sees the unmodified post-T5 features.

## Author-faithful FeRA (`fera.py`)

`AnimaFeraLoader` is for `networks.methods.fera` checkpoints — a different network family from the FEI-on-Hydra path above. Three architectural differences that drive the split:

1. **Single global router** owned by the network, not per-Linear. `_make_fera_pre_hook` computes FEI on the latent + runs the 2-layer `Linear → ReLU → Linear → softmax/τ` router once per `diffusion_model` forward and writes `fera_state["gates"]` of shape `(B, num_experts)`. Every per-Linear hook reads that same gate.
2. **Independent stacked experts** — `lora_down: (E, r, in)` and `lora_up: (E, out, r)` are flat Parameters, not Linear submodules. Saved keys end in `.lora_down` / `.lora_up` (no `.weight` suffix). `_make_fera_hook` does `einsum("...i,eri->...er")` for the down projection, multiplies by the broadcast gates, then `einsum("...er,eor->...o")` for the up — bit-identical to `FeRALinear.forward`.
3. **Multi-band FEI ordering.** The author network's `FrequencyEnergyIndicator` returns `[high, ..., low]` (high freq first), which differs from `adapter.py::_compute_fei_2band`'s `[e_low, e_high]`. `fera.py::_compute_fei_nband` matches the author-faithful ordering exactly — router weights are sensitive to band order. Don't share band-compute code with `adapter.py` even though both use the same Gaussian blur.

Detection prefers `ss_network_module == "networks.methods.fera"` metadata; falls back to a key sniff for `router.net.*` + stacked `lora_unet_*.lora_down`/`.lora_up`. `AnimaFeraLoader` and `AnimaAdapterLoader` should not both target the same checkpoint — author-faithful FeRA and HydraLoRA-moe are alternative router schemes (mirrors the inference loader's `fera_mode`/`hydra_mode` check).

**Key resolution — direct walk, not `model_lora_keys_unet`.** ComfyUI's `comfy.lora.model_lora_keys_unet` was designed around the older UNet convention where Q/K/V live in separate Linears; it doesn't enumerate fused projections by default and (more importantly for us) doesn't always reach modules inside the LLM adapter sub-tree. `fera.py::_build_fera_key_map` walks `diffusion_model.named_modules()` directly and emits one `lora_unet_<dotted>` entry per `nn.Linear`, mirroring the training-side `FeRANetwork._scan_targets` convention exactly. The save format also writes split q/k/v on disk (see `networks/methods/fera.py::_split_fused_state_dict`), so checkpoint prefixes match ComfyUI's split modules without any conversion at load time.

Caveat: `is_mergeable() == False` on the training side because a router-mixed output isn't a single ΔW — there's no merge-into-DiT path. Stay on the live-routing node.

## Coexistence

Plain-LoRA and Hydra paths target disjoint key prefixes (`_extract_lora_sd` skips `lora_ups.*`, `_parse_hydra` requires `lora_ups`), so a mixed checkpoint where only some Linears are Hydra-routed runs both paths in the same load without conflict. Don't reintroduce mutual-exclusion checks.

Author-faithful FeRA is a different story: its prefixes overlap with Hydra's at the `lora_unet_*` level but the suffixes differ (`.lora_down` vs `.lora_down.weight`). The two paths still won't collide on parsing (each parser keys off its own suffix), but installing both on the same Linear would chain two hooks — additive composition with no semantic basis. Pick one loader per workflow.

## Publishing

This node ships as a ComfyUI Registry package. To publish: run `make vendor-sync` **in the anima_lora repo** (refreshes this repo's `_vendor/` from the live kernels), commit the refreshed `_vendor/` here, bump version in `pyproject.toml`, push to GitHub, then `comfy node publish --token $COMFY_REG`. The token is in `anima_lora/.env`. The vendor-sync step is **load-bearing** — if you skip it, users get whatever stale router math last shipped while the live anima_lora training tree has moved on. See [[feedback_vendor_sync]].
